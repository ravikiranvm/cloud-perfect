## Notes

### Creation of S3 bucket
- Bucket name should not contain uppercase letters. 
- Bucket name should be DNS compliant.
- Lifecycle metadata is not provider specific but terraform specific feature. Use **prevent_destroy** to prevent accidental deletion of the s3 bucket.

1. First write the S3 bucket creation block.
2. Enable the Versioning.
3. Explicitly block public access to the bucket by enabling blocking of public acl, public policy.
4. Enable the server side encryption.
